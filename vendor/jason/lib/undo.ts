/**
 * Runs `edit` inside one Blockbench undo transaction.
 *
 * A finished edit is also reported to AI usage disclosure, which stamps the
 * project when the call belongs to an MCP client.
 *
 * The entry is finished with `label` when `edit` returns, or canceled and
 * reverted when it throws, so a partial failure never leaves a half-applied
 * scene in history. Aspect arrays may be mutated by `edit` (for example,
 * pushing newly created elements) because Blockbench re-reads them when the
 * edit finishes or is canceled.
 *
 * Blockbench's revert rebuilds its reference from the same aspect arrays, so it
 * cannot recreate an object that `edit` removed. An edit that deletes something
 * must therefore make the removal its last step and do any follow-up work
 * (scene refreshes, toolbar updates) after this function returns.
 *
 * @param aspects - Undo aspects snapshotted before the edit starts.
 * @param label - History entry label shown in Blockbench's Edit menu.
 * @param edit - Mutation to apply; its return value is passed through.
 * @param finishAspects - Aspects snapshotted after the edit when they differ from
 *   `aspects`. Blockbench serializes the objects listed in an aspect array, so an
 *   edit that removes objects (for example a texture) must finish with an aspect
 *   list that no longer names them, exactly as the native delete actions do.
 * @returns The value returned by `edit`.
 * @throws The original error from `edit` after reverting; an `AggregateError`
 *   carrying both errors when the revert itself also fails.
