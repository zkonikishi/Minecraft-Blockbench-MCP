/**
 * Blockbench MCP — public API for other Blockbench plugins.
 *
 * Copy this file into your plugin (for example `src/types/blockbench-mcp-api.d.ts`)
 * to get typed access to the `MCP` global that the MCP Server plugin installs.
 * Types only: nothing here runs at build time, and the MCP plugin is never
 * bundled into yours. The `z` property needs `zod` installed as a dev
 * dependency for its types (`bun add -d zod`); at runtime it is MCP's own
 * instance, so you never bundle zod either.
 *
 * Registration works whichever plugin Blockbench loads first. Push a setup entry
 * onto `MCP_QUEUE` from your `onload`; MCP drains the queue when it loads, and
 * once it is loaded each push runs immediately:
 *
 * ```ts
 * onload() {
 *   (globalThis.MCP_QUEUE ??= []).push({
 *     plugin: "my_plugin",
 *     setup(mcp) {
 *       mcp.registerTool({
 *         name: "my_plugin_greet",
 *         description: "Greets someone.",
 *         parameters: mcp.z.object({ name: mcp.z.string() }),
 *         execute: ({ name }) => `Hello, ${name}!`,
 *       });
 *     },
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Tools registered with a `plugin` id are removed automatically when that
 * plugin unloads. Every registration also returns a disposer for manual cleanup.
 *
 * Entries are kept: when the MCP plugin itself is reloaded, they run again, so
 * the tools of plugins that stayed loaded come back without a reload of their
 * own. An entry in the `{ plugin, setup }` form is dropped when that plugin
 * unloads; a bare function entry cannot be, so it should check that its plugin
 * is still loaded before registering.
 *
