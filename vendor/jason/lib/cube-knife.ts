/**
 * Headless cube knife.
 *
 * Blockbench's Knife tool splits cubes through `KnifeToolCubeContext.apply()`,
 * which calls the module-private `splitCube()` in `js/modeling/mesh/knife_tool.js`.
 * That context opens its own undo entry per cut and owns 3D preview gizmos, so it
 * cannot be composed into one reversible multi-cut edit. This module ports the
 * split itself; callers own the undo transaction and canvas refresh.
 *
 * One deliberate divergence: the UV fraction is measured over the inflated
 * (visual) span on every axis. Blockbench's `splitCube` applies the inflate
 * only to the x component of `from`/`to` (a scalar `V3_subtract`), so its
 * fraction is off for inflated cubes cut on y or z.
 *
 * Cube objects are Blockbench host state and are mutated in place by design.
 *
