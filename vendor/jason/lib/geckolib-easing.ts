/**
 * GeckoLib keyframe easing metadata.
 *
 * GeckoLib extends Blockbench keyframes with an `easing` name and an optional
 * `easingArgs` array that Blockbench itself has no concept of: the plugin
 * monkeypatches `Keyframe.prototype.getLerp`/`compileBedrockKeyframe` so the
 * eased value is both previewed and written into the exported animation JSON.
 * Nothing in the native keyframe API can author these, which is why the MCP
 * tools need their own description of the easing set.
 *
 * Names, argument-taking easings, and argument defaults mirror the GeckoLib
 * Blockbench plugin (MIT, `src/ts/easing.ts`, plugin 4.2.x). Keep this module
 * free of Blockbench globals so the docs generator can import it.
 *
